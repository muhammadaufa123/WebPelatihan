# Trainee-to-Talent Conversion Workflow Guide

## Overview

The talent scouting system in your LMS includes a comprehensive **trainee-to-talent conversion workflow** that allows students to seamlessly transition from being course trainees to becoming discoverable talents for recruiters. This process is **fully functional and production-ready**.

## ðŸ”„ Complete Workflow

### 1. Initial State: Trainee User
- User registers as a "trainee" through the registration form
- Assigned `trainee` role automatically
- Can access LMS courses and complete coursework
- **No talent capabilities initially**

### 2. Skill Acquisition (Automatic)
- As trainees complete courses and pass final quizzes, skills are **automatically added** to their profile
- Skills include:
  - Course name
  - Difficulty level
  - Acquisition date
  - Source (course completion)
- Users can see these skills accumulating in their profile

### 3. Talent Opt-In (Manual Process)
Users can become talents by visiting their **profile page** (`/profile`) where they will find:

#### Available Options:
- **Toggle**: "Make me available for talent scouting"
- **Additional Fields** (shown when opting in):
  - Hourly rate (USD)
  - Professional bio
  - Portfolio/website URL
  - Location
  - Phone number
  - Experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)

#### What Happens When Opting In:
1. âœ… Automatically assigned `talent` role (in addition to `trainee`)
2. âœ… Creates a `Talent` record in the database
3. âœ… User becomes discoverable by recruiters
4. âœ… Can access talent dashboard
5. âœ… Skills from completed courses are displayed to recruiters

### 4. Dual Access
Once converted, users have **dual access**:
- **LMS Platform**: Still functions as a trainee, can complete courses
- **Talent Platform**: Now visible to recruiters, can receive job requests

### 5. Opt-Out Capability
Users can **disable talent scouting** anytime:
- Unchecking the "available for scouting" option
- **Keeps the talent role** for easy re-enabling
- Talent record status set to inactive
- Not visible to recruiters

### 6. Re-Enabling
Users can **re-enable talent scouting** anytime:
- Simply check the "available for scouting" option again
- All previous talent information is restored
- Immediately becomes discoverable again

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Implementation

### Routes
```php
// Profile page (where conversion happens)
GET /profile â†’ profile.edit view

// Talent settings update
PATCH /profile/talent â†’ ProfileController@updateTalent

```

### Database Changes
When a user opts into talent scouting:

```sql
-- Users table updates
UPDATE users SET 
    available_for_scouting = 1,
    is_active_talent = 1,
    hourly_rate = ?,
    talent_bio = ?,
    portfolio_url = ?,
    location = ?,
    phone = ?,
    experience_level = ?;

-- Role assignment
INSERT INTO model_has_roles (role_id, model_type, model_id);

-- Talent record creation
INSERT INTO talents (user_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at);
```
