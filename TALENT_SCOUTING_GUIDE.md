# Talent Scouting System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds a simple talent scouting system to the existing Laravel LMS project with three new roles:

1. **Talent Admin** - Manages talent scouting operations
2. **Talent** - Individuals showcasing their skills
3. **Recruiter** - Companies/individuals looking for talent

## Database Structure

### New Tables Created:
- `talent_admins` - Minimal table with user_id and is_active
- `talents` - Minimal table with user_id and is_active  
- `recruiters` - Minimal table with user_id and is_active

All tables include soft deletes and timestamps, following the existing project patterns.

### New Roles (Spatie Permission):
- `talent_admin`
- `talent`
- `recruiter`

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Users Created

The system includes pre-created test users for each role:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Talent Admin | talentadmin@test.com | password123 |
| Talent | talent@test.com | password123 |
| Recruiter | recruiter@test.com | password123 |

### 2. Dashboard Routes

Each role has its own dashboard:

- **Talent Admin**: `/talent-admin/dashboard`
- **Talent**: `/talent/dashboard`  
- **Recruiter**: `/recruiter/dashboard`

### 3. Navigation

The sidebar navigation automatically shows role-specific dashboard links based on the user's assigned role:

- Uses Spatie Permission's `hasRole()` method for role checking
- Each role sees only their relevant dashboard link
- Icons are role-specific (users-cog, user-tie, search)

### 4. Testing Steps

1. **Login as Talent Admin**:
   - Go to login page
   - Use: talentadmin@test.com / password123
   - Should redirect to talent admin dashboard
   - Sidebar should show "Talent Admin Dashboard" link

2. **Login as Talent**:
   - Use: talent@test.com / password123
   - Should redirect to talent dashboard
   - Sidebar should show "Talent Dashboard" link

3. **Login as Recruiter**:
   - Use: recruiter@test.com / password123
   - Should redirect to recruiter dashboard
   - Sidebar should show "Recruiter Dashboard" link

## Architecture Notes

### Role Separation
- New roles are completely separate from existing LMS roles (admin, trainer, trainee)
- Uses Spatie Permission for role management
- Legacy `roles_id` system remains untouched for existing functionality

### User Relationships
The User model now includes relationships to:
```php
$user->talentAdmin()  // Returns TalentAdmin record
$user->talent()       // Returns Talent record  
$user->recruiter()    // Returns Recruiter record
```

### Controllers
- `TalentAdminController` - Handles talent admin functionality
- `TalentController` - Handles talent functionality
- `RecruiterController` - Handles recruiter functionality

Each controller currently has a basic dashboard method that renders a role-specific view.

### Views
Dashboard views are located at:
- `resources/views/admin/talent_admin/dashboard.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/talent/dashboard.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/recruiter/dashboard.blade.php`

## Future Enhancements

This minimal implementation provides the foundation for:

1. **Talent Profiles** - Add fields for skills, experience, portfolio
2. **Job Postings** - Allow recruiters to post opportunities
3. **Matching System** - Connect talents with suitable opportunities
4. **Admin Management** - Allow talent admins to manage users and activities
5. **Messaging System** - Communication between talents and recruiters
6. **Search & Filtering** - Advanced talent discovery features
