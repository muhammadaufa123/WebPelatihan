# UX Simplification: Removed Redundant "Check Availability" Button

## Issue Addressed
The talent cards had redundant UI elements that displayed the same availability information in multiple places:
1. **Availability Status Section**: Already clearly shows talent's busy status and "busy until" date
2. **Check Availability Button**: Showed a modal with the same information

## Solution Implemented

### 🔧 Changes Made

**Removed Redundant Elements**:
- ❌ "Check Availability" button for busy talents
- ❌ `showAvailabilityInfo()` JavaScript function (54 lines of code removed)
- ❌ Complex conditional logic with multiple button states

**Simplified Logic**:
- ✅ Clean, simple condition: Only show "Request Talent" button when talent is available
- ✅ Clear visual feedback through availability status badges
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load for recruiters

### 📋 Before vs After

**Before**:
```php
@if(isset($talent->availability_status) && $talent->availability_status['available'])
    <button>Request Talent</button>
@elseif(isset($talent->availability_status) && !$talent->availability_status['available'])
    <button onclick="showAvailabilityInfo(...)">Check Availability</button>
@else
    <button>Request Talent</button>
@endif
```

**After**:
```php
@if(isset($talent->availability_status) && $talent->availability_status['available'])
    <button>Request Talent</button>
@endif
```

### 🎯 UX Improvements

1. **Clearer Information Hierarchy**
   - Availability status is prominently displayed in the status section
   - No duplicate information in buttons and modals
   - Recruiter immediately sees availability without extra clicks

2. **Reduced Interaction Complexity**
   - No unnecessary button clicks to see availability information
   - Information is visible at a glance
   - Streamlined decision-making process

3. **Visual Clarity**
   - Available talents show green "Available Now" badge + "Request Talent" button
   - Busy talents show orange "Busy until [date]" badge with no action button
   - Clear visual differentiation between available and unavailable talents

### 📊 Expected User Behavior

**Available Talent**:
- ✅ Green "Available Now" status visible
- ✅ "Request Talent" button clickable
- ✅ Single-click to start request process

**Busy Talent**:
- ✅ Orange "Busy until [date]" status clearly visible

- ✅ Recruiter can immediately see when talent will be available

**Completed Project Talent**:
- ✅ Shows "Project Completed" status in request history
- ✅ Shows "Available Now" in availability status
- ✅ "Request Talent" button available for new projects

### 🧹 Code Quality Benefits

   - Removed 54 lines of JavaScript code
